# TanzschulApp
Hey there i am german hav no idea how to format this text document und would like to present you my project in few sentences.
Everybody in germany wo wants to pass the so called "Abitur" (similar to A-Levels/Bacalaureat) hast to write his own seminar paper.
As you might guess this Project is part of  my "Seminar Arbeit"(seminar paper).
Now that i explained you why i opend this repository you might want to know what this App should and hopfully will be able to do.
So.... Have you ever participated a ballroom dance course or ball romm dancing in general ? If so you might have experienced that
even today very outdated mehtods are in use to impart between people who would like to learn to dance but havent found a dancing partner yet. 
The Intention of my app is  do revolutionize the oboslete methods an to speed up the searching Process for an dancing Partner.
