# TanzschulApp
Hey there i would like to present you my project in few sentences.
First of all i am from germany (I hope that excuses spelling mistakes, and weird expressions especially in my project ^^).
Everybody in germany who wants to pass the so called "Abitur" (similar to A-Levels/Bacalaureat) has to write his or her own seminar paper.
As you might guess the "TanzschulApp" project is part of  my "Seminar Arbeit"(seminar paper).
Now that i explained you why i opend this repository you might want to know what this App is good for. :D
So.... Have you ever participated a ballroom dance course or ball romm dancing in general? If so you might have experienced that
even today very outdated mehtods are in use to impart between people who would like to learn to dance but haven´t found a dancing partner yet.
The Intention of my app is  do revolutionize the oboslete methods by speeding up the searching process to find a dancing partner.
