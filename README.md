# TanzschulApp
Hey there, I would like to present you my project in few sentences.
Everybody in Germany who wants to pass the so called "Abitur" (similar to A-Levels/Bacalaureat) has to write his or her own seminar paper.
The "TanzschulApp" project is part of my "Seminar Arbeit"(seminar paper).
Now that I explained you why I opened this repository you might want to know what this App is good for. :D
So.... Have you ever participated in a ballroom dance course or in ballroom dancing in general? If so you might have experienced that even today very outdated methods are in use to help people finding a dancing partner. 
The Intention of my app is do revolutionize the obsolete methods by speeding up the searching process to find a dancing partner.
